Introduction to C Programming for Beginners and Intermediate levels. Course ECS102 in IISERB (2018-19). It consists of a set of simple C programs given across a span of 13 weeks. All the folders contain the programs and the problem statement provided.

## Run on Linux/Windows Terminal

Make sure a C/C++ compiler is already installed on your system. I used VSCode as the code editor, you can follow this [guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw) to setup the compiler and VSCode for C/C++ on Windows and Linux device.

To run the code on terminal, run the commands below after replacing the 'file_name' with your file's name:

```shell
>>> gcc 'file_name'.c -o 'file_name'.o
>>> ./'file_name'.o
```
